    "polfilt is the polarization filter, mideled as a thin box. Three empty lists are used to hold electric, magnetic and resultant field vector components. The components are defined for each field in the next if statement from 0-60, where the wave will travel before hitting the polarization filter. Each component has a position defined in the x direction that assigns vector arrows to 100 positions equally spaced along the x-axis. Axes are defined for each component, E in the y direction, B in the z direction, and R in between the y and z. The end of the if statement is serving to assign only the electric field components to positions past 60, where the wave gets polarized. "

    "The wave equation psi is a traveling wave with two variables, x and t. The next while loop is defining a new variable to be placed in the Psi function using the same method as before. Referring to the appended lists, instead of y it is now i and the axis for vector components for each field are defined by placing the twave function containing the i variable into the vector axis. This block serves to actually get the arrows to oscillate according to the wave equation and in which direction. This method was very convenient because I easy appended 100 vector components and got them to oscillate using just open lists and for loops."
